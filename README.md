# CUHK-Business-project
The findings in my project in Business School, the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

## Mission:

You work for a lending company that provides small loans to individual borrowers for 3 or
5 years. The company has collected data on the loans granted in the past few years.
Your responsibility is to conduct analysis on the data and uncover insights about the
loans’ performance.
Good loans are the ones where the status is current or fully paid. Bad loans are the ones
where the status is default, in grace period or late.
